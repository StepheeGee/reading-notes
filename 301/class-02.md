# State and Props

## Class 2: 11/27/23

**This assignment explores key concepts in React, focusing on the React lifecycle and the distinction between state and props.**

### Reading

[React lifecycle](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)


1. **Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?**  
   - The 'constructor' happens first, followed by 'render' and then 'componentDidMount' in the React lifecycle.

2. **What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?**  
   - The execution of the 'constructor' method within a component.

3. **Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates**  
   - constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, componentWillUnmount

4. **What does componentDidMount do?**  
   - `componentDidMount` is a React lifecycle method that is invoked immediately after a component is mounted or inserted into the DOM. It's often used for actions that require DOM nodes or for initializing processes dependent on the component's presence in the DOM.

5. **What types of things can you pass in the props?**  
   - In props, you can pass various types of data, including strings, numbers, arrays, objects, functions, and even React components.

6. **What is the big difference between props and state?**  
   - The main difference between props and state is that props are passed into a component from its parent, and they are immutable (read-only) within the component. State, however, is managed internally by the component and can be changed using `setState()`.

7. **When do we re-render our application?**  
   - We re-render our application when there are changes in the component's state or props.

8. **What are some examples of things that we could store in state?**  
   - Examples of things that could be stored in a component's state include user input data, UI state (like toggles or modals), fetched data from APIs, or any data that might change during the component's lifecycle.

  <summary>What does id="root" in app.jsx mean?</summary>
  
In a React application's entry file, typically `index.js` or `app.jsx`, you'll often encounter an element with `id="root"`. This element serves as the mounting point where your React application is injected into the HTML document.

#### Example:

```javascript
// index.js or app.jsx

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

#### Explanation:

- `ReactDOM.render()` is a method in React used to render React elements into the DOM.
- The second argument of `ReactDOM.render()` specifies the target container where the React application will be rendered.
- `document.getElementById('root')` selects an element from the HTML document with the id `root`.
- This element is typically a `<div>` or another container specified in the HTML file where the React application will be injected.

#### Meaning:

The `id="root"` in `app.jsx` refers to a placeholder element in the HTML document where the React application will be mounted/rendered. React uses this element as the entry point to inject the entire component tree generated by the React application.

It acts as the single mounting point for your entire React application, and React renders and manages the app's components within this specific DOM element.

  <summary>What is the state of an application in React?</summary>
  
In React, the "state" of an application refers to the data that a component manages and can change over time. It represents the current condition or information within a component that influences its behavior and appearance.

#### Example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  // Using state in a functional component with the useState hook
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    // Modifying the state using setCount
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Explanation:

- `useState` is a React hook used to add state to functional components. It initializes a piece of state (here, `count`) and returns a function (`setCount`) to update that state.
  
- `count` is the state variable that holds the current count in this example.

- `setCount` is a function provided by `useState` that allows updating the value of `count`. When `setCount` is called, it notifies React that the state has changed, triggering a re-render to update the UI.

#### What's Happening:

- Initially, `count` is set to `0` when the component is rendered for the first time.

- When the "Increment" button is clicked, the `increment` function is executed, calling `setCount(count + 1)`. This updates the `count` state by incrementing its value by one.

- As a result, React re-renders the component, and the updated `count` value is displayed in the UI (`<p>Count: {count}</p>`).

#### Simplified Understanding:

Think of "state" as the memory of your component. It's like a container where you can store and update data that your component needs to remember. Whenever something important changes (like the count in our example), React knows to refresh the displayed information.

  <summary>Using prop as an attribute for a header title</summary>
  
In React, props can be passed to components as attributes to configure and customize their behavior or content.

#### Example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Header = (props) => {
  return (
    <header>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
    </header>
  );
};

// Usage of the Header component with prop as an attribute
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="Welcome to My App" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

#### Explanation:

- In the `Header` component, `props` is received as an argument, and `props.title` is used to dynamically render the header title.
  
- `title="Welcome to My App"` is passed as an attribute when using the `Header` component within `App`.

- `title` in `<Header title="Welcome to My App" />` is a prop, which is an object containing data passed from the parent component (`App`) to the child component (`Header`).

- Inside `Header`, `props.title` accesses the `title` prop's value, rendering "Welcome to My App" as the header title (`<h1>` content).

#### Prop as an Object:

In React, props are passed as an object where the attribute name becomes the key, and the attribute's value becomes the value associated with that key within the `props` object. For instance, in `<Header title="Welcome to My App" />`, `props.title` represents the value "Welcome to My App" associated with the key "title".

This way, components can be made dynamic and reusable by accepting different values for props, enabling flexible content based on the data passed from their parent components.

<summary>`.map()` method </summary>

In the context of React and the Michael Jackson SPA example, let's delve deeper:

### The `.map()` Function in `Albums.jsx`:

```javascript
{albumsData.map((album, index) => (
  <div key={index}>
    <h2>{album.title}</h2>
    <img src={album.image} alt={album.title} />
    <Songs songs={album.songs} />
  </div>
))}
```

Here's a breakdown:

- `albumsData.map()` iterates through each element (album object) in the `albumsData` array.
- For each album object, it executes the code within the curly braces `{}`.
- `(album, index) => (...)` is an arrow function that takes two parameters: `album` (representing each album object in the array) and `index` (the index of the current album object).
- For every album in `albumsData`, it generates a `<div>` element containing:
  - `<h2>` with the album title (`{album.title}`)
  - An `<img>` tag with the album image (`src={album.image}`) and an alt attribute for accessibility (`alt={album.title}`)
  - A `Songs` component, passing the songs data (`<Songs songs={album.songs} />`)

### The `.map()` Advantage in React:

Using `.map()` in React is particularly beneficial for rendering dynamic content, such as when dealing with lists or arrays of items (like albums in this case). Instead of manually writing code for each album to display its details, `.map()` automates the process.

With `.map()`, you can:
- Dynamically generate components based on data in an array.
- Ensure a more maintainable codebase by avoiding repetition and allowing scalability. If you add more albums to `albumsData`, the application will display them automatically without the need for additional code.

In summary, `.map()` is a versatile method in JavaScript that's especially useful in React for dynamically generating UI elements based on data in an array, promoting cleaner and more scalable code.
