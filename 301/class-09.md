# Functional Programming: Modularization, Refactoring

## Class 9: 12.6.23 (Day before class)

**Summary/Statement:** This assignment explores concepts related to functional programming, emphasizing the definition of functional programming, pure functions, immutability, and referential transparency. Additionally, it includes a video tutorial focusing on modules and the 'require' functionality in Node.js.

1. **What is functional programming?**  
   - Functional programming is a programming paradigm centered around the use of pure functions, immutable data, and declarative style, emphasizing the evaluation of functions and avoiding side effects.

2. **What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**  
   - A pure function is a function that always produces the same output for a given input and doesn’t cause side effects. It relies only on its input parameters and doesn't modify any external state or data.

3. **What are the benefits of a pure function?**  
   - Pure functions offer benefits such as predictability, easier testing, better maintainability, and facilitating parallel execution.

4. **What is immutability?**  
   - Immutability refers to the concept of data that cannot be changed after it’s created. Immutable data remains constant, and any operation on it creates new data rather than modifying the existing data.

5. **What is Referential transparency?**  
   - Referential transparency means that a function can be replaced by its value without changing the program's behavior, ensuring that a function call can be substituted with its returned value.

6. **What is a module?**  
   - A module is a reusable block of code that encapsulates related functionality, allowing it to be used in other parts of the application.

7. **What does the word ‘require’ do?**  
   - The 'require' function in Node.js is used to include (import) modules or files into the current file/module, making their functionality accessible.

8. **How do we bring another module into the file we are working in?**  
   - To include another module, we use the 'require' function followed by the path to the module.

9. **What do we have to do to make a module available?**  
   - To make a module available, it needs to be exported using the 'module.exports' or 'exports' object within the module file.
