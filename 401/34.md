# API Deployment

## Class 34 - 2.21.2024

## Statement

This assignment focuses on three key aspects of Django web development: the best practices for organizing and configuring Django settings, the integration of the White Noise library for efficient static file serving, and the implementation of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in a Django project to control access to resources. Each topic contributes to the overall understanding and proficiency in building robust and secure Django applications.

## Questions

### 1. What are the key principles to follow when organizing and configuring Django settings for a project, according to the “Django Settings Best Practices” reading?

#### a. **Keep settings in a separate module:**

   - Store settings in a module (e.g., `settings.py`) to maintain a clean and organized structure.

#### b. **Use environment variables:**

   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information.

   - Use environment variables to store secret keys, database configurations, and other sensitive data.

#### c. **Split settings into different files:**

   - Divide settings into multiple files based on their functionality (e.g., `base.py`, `development.py`, `production.py`).

   - Use `local_settings.py` for machine-specific settings.

#### d. **Use a settings package:**

   - Organize settings as a Python package for better modularity and maintainability.

#### e. **Use default settings whenever possible:**

   - Leverage Django's default settings to minimize manual configuration.

#### f. **Document your settings:**

   - Provide comments and documentation to explain the purpose and usage of each setting.

#### g. **Conditional settings:**

   - Use conditional statements to set different configurations based on the environment (e.g., development or production).

### 2. How does the White Noise library contribute to the efficient serving of static files in a Django application, and what are the steps to integrate it into a project?

#### a. **Contribution to Efficient Serving:**

   - **Middleware for serving static files:** White Noise can be used as middleware to serve static files directly, reducing the need for a separate web server (like Nginx or Apache) in some cases.

   - **Compressed file support:** White Noise supports serving pre-compressed versions of static files (gzip, Brotli), enhancing efficiency.

#### b. **Integration Steps:**

   1. Install White Noise using pip: `pip install whitenoise`.
   2. Add `'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware'` to the `MIDDLEWARE` setting in your Django project.
   3. Configure White Noise by adding the following to your settings:
      ```python
      STATIC_URL = '/static/'
      STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
      ```
   4. Collect static files: `python manage.py collectstatic`.

### 3. What is the purpose of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in web applications, and how can it be implemented and configured in a Django project to control access to resources?

#### a. **Purpose of CORS:**

   - CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control access to resources from a different origin (domain).

   - It prevents potential security risks by restricting web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.

#### b. **Implementation in Django:**

   1. Install Django CORS headers: `pip install django-cors-headers`.
   2. Add `'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware'` to the `MIDDLEWARE` setting.
   3. Configure CORS settings in your `settings.py`:
      ```python
      CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
          "http://localhost:3000",  # Example: Allow requests from this origin
      ]
      ```
   4. Adjust settings based on your specific requirements, such as allowing specific headers or methods.

CORS allows you to define which origins are permitted to access your resources, providing flexibility while maintaining security.
