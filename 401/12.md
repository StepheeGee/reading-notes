# Pandas

## Class 12 - 1.22.24

## Statement

The assignment involves understanding the Pandas library in Python for data manipulation and analysis. It covers the purpose and basic functionality of Pandas, primary data structures (Series and DataFrame), common operations for data analysis, and the process of loading datasets into Pandas DataFrames from various file formats.

## Questions

1.Explain the purpose and basic functionality of the Pandas library. What are some common operations that can be performed on data using Pandas, and how do they contribute to data analysis and manipulation?

   Pandas is a powerful open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python. Its primary purpose is to provide data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly. The key component of Pandas is the DataFrame, a two-dimensional tabular data structure resembling a spreadsheet or SQL table. Some common operations include:
   - **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing data, dealing with duplicates, and transforming data.
   - **Data Exploration:** Descriptive statistics, summarization, and data profiling.
   - **Data Manipulation:** Slicing, indexing, merging, and reshaping data.
   - **Data Analysis:** Aggregation, grouping, and filtering data.


2.What are the primary data structures in Pandas, and how do they differ in terms of use cases?

   - **Series:** A one-dimensional labeled array, similar to a column in a spreadsheet. It can hold any data type.
   - **DataFrame:** A two-dimensional table with rows and columns. It is the primary data structure in Pandas and is widely used for data manipulation and analysis.
   - **Panel (Less Common):** A three-dimensional data structure, but it's less commonly used compared to Series and DataFrame.

   The primary difference lies in their dimensionality and use cases. Series is suitable for one-dimensional data, DataFrame for two-dimensional tabular data, and Panel for three-dimensional data.


3.Describe the process of loading a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. What are some common file formats that can be used, and which Pandas functions are utilized to read these formats?

   - **Common File Formats:** Pandas supports various file formats for data input, including CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL, HDF5, and more.
   - **Loading Process:**
     1. **CSV File Example:**
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
        ```
     2. **Excel File Example:**
        ```python
        df = pd.read_excel('your_dataset.xlsx')
        ```
     3. **JSON File Example:**
        ```python
        df = pd.read_json('your_dataset.json')
        ```

   Pandas functions like `read_csv`, `read_excel`, and `read_json` are used to read data from respective file formats into a DataFrame. Once loaded, the data can be easily manipulated and analyzed using the various Pandas operations mentioned earlier.
