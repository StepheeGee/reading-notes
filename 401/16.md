## Statement

This lesson covers the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how it differs from traditional server-based architectures.

## Questions

1. What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?

   - **Event-Driven:** Serverless architectures are often event-driven, meaning that functions are triggered by events such as HTTP requests, database changes, or file uploads.
   - **No Server Management:** In a serverless environment, developers do not need to manage servers. Cloud providers automatically handle server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance.
   - **Pay-per-Use Billing:** Serverless platforms typically follow a pay-per-use model, where users are billed based on the actual usage of resources rather than pre-allocated server capacity.
   - **Auto-Scaling:** Serverless platforms automatically scale resources based on demand. Functions can scale from zero to handle thousands of concurrent requests.
   - **Stateless:** Serverless functions are designed to be stateless, meaning they don't retain information between invocations. State is typically managed externally, such as in a database or storage service.

   **Differences from Traditional Server-Based Architectures:**
   - **No Server Provisioning:** In traditional architectures, developers need to provision and manage servers to host applications. In serverless, this responsibility is abstracted away.
   - **Scaling:** Serverless platforms automatically scale functions based on demand, whereas in traditional architectures, scaling often requires manual intervention.
   - **Cost Model:** Traditional architectures involve paying for server resources even when not in use, while serverless follows a more granular pay-per-use model.
   - **Infrastructure Management:** In serverless, developers focus more on code, and infrastructure management is handled by the platform. In traditional architectures, managing servers is a significant part of the development process.


2. How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?

   - **Sign Up:** Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
   - **Install Vercel CLI:** Install the Vercel CLI using a package manager like npm: `npm install -g vercel`.
   - **Create Project:** Navigate to your project directory and run `vercel init` to set up a new Vercel project.
   - **Deploy:** Run `vercel` in the project directory to deploy your project. Vercel will provide you with a unique URL for your deployed application.
   - **Serverless Functions:** To create a serverless function, create a directory named `api` in your project, and inside it, create a file with a `.js` extension (e.g., `api/myfunction.js`). This file will contain your serverless function.


3. What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?

   - **API (Application Programming Interface):** An API is a set of rules that allows one software application to interact with another. In Python, APIs are often used to access and manipulate data from external sources, such as web services, databases, or third-party platforms.
   - **Utilizing APIs in Python:**
     - Use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to API endpoints.
     - Parse the JSON responses using Python's built-in `json` module.
     - APIs often require authentication, and you may need to include API keys or tokens in your requests.


4. What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?

   - **Requests Library:** The `requests` library in Python simplifies the process of making HTTP requests.
   - **Example of a Basic GET Request:**
     ```python
     import requests

     # Make a GET request to a sample API
     response = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

     # Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
     if response.status_code == 200:
         # Parse the JSON response
         data = response.json()
         print(data)
     else:
         print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
     ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - The `get` function from the `requests` library is used to send a GET request to the specified URL.
     - The `status_code` attribute of the response object indicates the HTTP status code returned by the server.
     - If the status code is 200 (OK), the response's JSON content can be accessed using the `json` method.

   This example demonstrates a basic interaction with an API using the `requests` library in Python, retrieving data from a sample endpoint.
