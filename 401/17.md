# Web Scraping with Python

## Class 17 - 1.29.24 

## Statement

This lesson is about web scraping. Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using various techniques. Web scraping is a crucial part of data collection and data analysis.


## Questions

1. What are the key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites?

   - **Static Websites:**
     - Content remains the same for all users and is directly served from the HTML files.
     - Traditional web scraping techniques, like making HTTP requests and parsing HTML, work well.
     - Pages are pre-rendered on the server, and there's no client-side JavaScript execution.

   - **Dynamic Websites:**
     - Content is often generated dynamically using JavaScript after the initial HTML is loaded.
     - Additional techniques are needed to handle the asynchronous loading of data.
     - Techniques may include using headless browsers or browser automation tools.

2. 




2. Explain at least three techniques or best practices that can be employed to avoid getting blocked while scraping websites.


   - **Use of Headers:** Set appropriate headers in your HTTP requests to mimic a real browser. Include a User-Agent header and, if needed, other headers that the website expects.

   - **Request Rate Limiting:** Avoid making too many requests in a short period. Implement delays between requests to mimic human behavior and reduce the likelihood of being flagged as a bot.

   - **Rotate IP Addresses:** Use proxy servers or rotate IP addresses to avoid being detected and blocked. This helps distribute requests across different IP addresses.

3. What is Playwright, and how does it assist in web scraping tasks? Provide an example of a use case where Playwright would be particularly beneficial.

   - **Playwright Overview:**
     - Playwright is a browser automation library that allows for browser automation in various programming languages (such as Python, JavaScript, and others).
     - It can be used to interact with modern web applications and perform tasks like web scraping, testing, and taking screenshots.

   - **Use Case for Playwright:**
     - One of the significant benefits of Playwright is its ability to interact with dynamic websites that heavily rely on JavaScript for content rendering.
     - Playwright allows you to automate actions, such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and waiting for asynchronous content to load, which is crucial for scraping dynamic websites.

   - **Example:**
     ```python
     from playwright.sync import sync_playwright

     with sync_playwright() as p:
         browser = p.chromium.launch()
         context = browser.new_context()
         page = context.new_page()

         page.goto('https://example.com')
         title = page.title()
         print(f'Title of the page: {title}')

         browser.close()
     ```

4. Describe the purpose of using Xpath in web scraping, and provide an example of an Xpath expression to select a specific HTML element from a webpage.

   - **XPath Overview:**
     - XPath is a query language for selecting nodes from an XML or HTML document.
     - In web scraping, XPath is commonly used to navigate and select elements from the HTML structure.

   - **Example XPath Expression:**
     - Suppose you want to select the text inside the `<h1>` tag with the class "title" on a webpage. The XPath expression would be:
       ```xpath
       //h1[@class='title']/text()
       ```
     - This expression selects the text content inside the `<h1>` element with the class "title."

   - **Purpose:**
     - XPath is powerful for navigating complex HTML structures, especially when elements have specific attributes or relationships.
     - It allows you to target elements precisely, making it easier to extract the desired data from a webpage.

   - **Note:** XPath can be used with various programming languages and tools, such as Python with libraries like `lxml` or `xpath` in combination with `requests` for web scraping tasks.
