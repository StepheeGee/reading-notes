## Statement

In this assignment, we used regular expressions in Python to search for specific patterns in a string.

## Questions

**1: How can you use regular expressions in Python to search for specific patterns in a string, and what is the primary module to work with them?**

In Python, you can use regular expressions to search for specific patterns in a string using the `re` module. The `re` module provides functions and methods for working with regular expressions. To use it, you import the `re` module and then use functions like `re.search()` or `re.findall()` to search for patterns in a given string.

```python
import re

text = "This is an example string with a pattern 123-456-7890."

# Search for a phone number pattern
pattern = r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}'
match = re.search(pattern, text)

if match:
    print("Phone number found:", match.group())
else:
    print("Phone number not found.")
```

**2: What is the purpose of the shutil module in Python, and provide an example of a common use case for file or directory management with this module?**

The `shutil` module in Python is used for file and directory operations, providing a higher-level interface compared to some of the lower-level operations available in the `os` module. Its purpose is to simplify file and directory management tasks. 

A common use case for `shutil` is copying files or directories. Here's an example:

```python
import shutil

# Source and destination paths
source_path = 'source_directory'
destination_path = 'destination_directory'

# Copy the entire directory from source to destination
shutil.copytree(source_path, destination_path)
```

**3: Compare and contrast the os and shutil modules. When would you choose to use one over the other?**

The `os` module and `shutil` module in Python both deal with file and directory operations, but they serve different purposes.

- **`os` module:** It provides a lower-level interface and is more focused on basic operating system-dependent functionality. It includes functions like `os.path.join()`, `os.listdir()`, and `os.remove()`.

- **`shutil` module:** It provides a higher-level interface and is more focused on file and directory management tasks. It includes functions like `shutil.copy()`, `shutil.move()`, and `shutil.rmtree()`.

When to choose one over the other depends on the complexity of the task. For basic file and directory operations, `os` might be sufficient. However, for more complex tasks, such as copying entire directory trees, handling file permissions, or dealing with archive formats, `shutil` is often a more convenient choice.
