# Cryptography

## Class 18 - 1.30.2024

## Statement -

This assignment covers fundamental concepts in cryptography and encryption, exploring the basic principle behind historical ciphers like the Caesar Cipher and their applications.

## Questions

1. **What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher, and how was it used historically?**

   - *Basic Principle:* The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The shift value is the key to the cipher. For example, with a shift of 3, A would be encrypted as D, B as E, and so on.
   - *Historical Use:* Julius Caesar is often attributed to its usage, where he reportedly used a shift of three to encrypt his private messages. It's a simple form of encryption and can be easily broken with modern cryptographic techniques due to its predictable nature.

2. **What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?**

   - *Symmetric Encryption:* Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. The key must be kept secret between the communicating parties.
   - *Asymmetric Encryption:* Involves a pair of keys - a public key used for encryption and a private key used for decryption. The public key can be shared openly, but the private key must be kept secret.
   - *Secure Communication:* Asymmetric encryption is often used in secure communication today. It enables secure key exchange (e.g., Diffie-Hellman key exchange) and digital signatures, ensuring confidentiality and integrity in communication without the need for both parties to share a secret key.

3. **How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cryptography.**

   - *Random Number Generation in Computers:*
     - *Pseudo-Random Number Generation (PRNG):* Algorithms that generate sequences of numbers that appear random but are deterministic. They start from an initial seed value.
     - *True Random Number Generation (TRNG):* Based on physical processes that are inherently unpredictable, like atmospheric noise or radioactive decay.
     - *Cryptography Use Cases:* TRNGs are preferred for cryptographic purposes as they provide higher unpredictability, making it more difficult for adversaries to predict or reproduce the generated numbers.

4. **Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and decryption?**

   - *Encryption:* The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and a key. It ensures that unauthorized entities cannot understand the original data.
   - *Decryption:* The reverse process of encryption, converting ciphertext back to plaintext using the decryption algorithm and the key. It allows authorized parties to recover the original data.

5. **Explain the difference between encryption and decryption with an analogy.**

   - *Locked Box Analogy:*
     - *Encryption:* Imagine putting your message in a locked box (ciphertext) and only you have the key to unlock it (decryption key). Others can see the box but can't open it without the key, ensuring your message's secrecy.
     - *Decryption:* When you receive the locked box, you use your private key (the key you kept secret) to unlock it and reveal the original message inside (plaintext). Others who don't have the key can't open the box.
