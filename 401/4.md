# Classes & Objects

## 1.11.24

## Statement

This assignment discusses the fundamental concepts of classes and objects in Python, emphasizing their role as blueprints for creating instances and facilitating the bundling of data and functionality

## Questions

### What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?

**Classes:**
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.
- Classes are used to bundle data and functionality together.
- They provide a way to model real-world entities and their interactions in a program.

**Objects:**
- An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity created from a class.
- Objects have attributes (characteristics) and methods (actions) associated with the class they belong to.
- Multiple objects can be created from the same class, each with its own set of attributes.

**Creating and Managing Instances:**
- To create an instance of a class, you call the class as if it were a function.
- Instances are created with specific values for their attributes.
- Attributes can be accessed using dot notation (`object.attribute`) and methods using the same notation (`object.method()`).
- Instances allow us to work with specific data and perform actions associated with the class.

Example:
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says woof!")

# Creating instances
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Charlie", 2)

# Accessing attributes and calling methods
print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy
dog2.bark()       # Output: Charlie says woof!
```

### Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?

**Recursion:**
- Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem.
- It's a way of solving problems by breaking them down into smaller instances of the same problem.

**Example: Factorial Calculation:**
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

result = factorial(5)  # Output: 120
```

**Best Practices for Recursive Functions:**
1. **Base Case:** Ensure there is a base case to terminate the recursion. It defines the simplest scenario where the function returns a known value without making further recursive calls.
2. **Progress Towards Base Case:** Ensure that each recursive call moves towards the base case. This ensures that the problem becomes simpler with each recursion.
3. **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially for large recursion depths. Consider tail recursion optimization or using an iterative approach for efficiency.

### What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.

**pytest Fixtures:**
- Fixtures in pytest provide a way to set up and tear down resources needed for tests.
- They help in creating a consistent environment for tests by providing data or initializing objects before each test.
- Fixtures are defined using the `@pytest.fixture` decorator.

**Code Coverage:**
- Code coverage is a measure of how much of your code is covered by tests.
- It helps identify areas of code that are not exercised by your test suite.
- Tools like `pytest-cov` can be used to measure code coverage during testing.

**Using pytest Fixtures with Code Coverage:**
- Define fixtures to set up necessary resources for tests.
- Run tests using `pytest` and include the `--cov` option to measure code coverage.
- Analyze the coverage report to identify untested parts of the code.

Example:
```python
# test_module.py
import pytest

class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

@pytest.fixture
def calculator():
    return Calculator()

def test_addition(calculator):
    assert calculator.add(2, 3) == 5
```

In the terminal:
```bash
pytest --cov=test_module
```

This command runs tests in `test_module.py` and provides a code coverage report.

**Benefits:**
- Fixtures help in maintaining a clean test environment.
- Code coverage ensures that tests cover a significant portion of the codebase.
- Using them together improves the quality and maintainability of the project by identifying areas that need more testing.
