# Ten Thousand Game 1

## Class 6 - 1/12/24

## Statement

This lesson covers Python's random module, software risk analysis steps, test coverage's importance, and Big O notation in algorithms.

## Questions

### 1. How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?

The `random` module in Python provides functions for generating random numbers and making selections. Some common functions include:
- `random()`: Returns a random floating-point number in the range [0.0, 1.0).
- `randint(a, b)`: Returns a random integer between a and b (inclusive).
- `choice(seq)`: Returns a randomly selected element from the given sequence.
- `shuffle(seq)`: Shuffles the elements of a sequence randomly.

Example:
```python
import random

random_float = random.random()
random_integer = random.randint(1, 10)
random_choice = random.choice(["apple", "banana", "orange"])
```

### 2. In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?

**Risk analysis** in software development involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing potential risks that could impact the success of a project. Key steps in conducting risk analysis include:
1. **Risk Identification:** Identify potential risks that could affect the project, considering both internal and external factors.
2. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate the probability and potential impact of each identified risk.
3. **Risk Prioritization:** Prioritize risks based on their severity and likelihood, focusing on those with the highest impact.
4. **Risk Mitigation Planning:** Develop strategies to mitigate or minimize the impact of high-priority risks.
5. **Monitoring and Control:** Continuously monitor identified risks throughout the project and adjust mitigation strategies as needed.

### 3. What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing?

**Test coverage** measures the extent to which a test suite covers the code or functionality of a software application. It is important as it helps assess the thoroughness of testing. However, it can be potentially misleading because high test coverage does not guarantee the absence of defects. It's crucial to consider the quality of test cases and ensure they cover diverse scenarios. High coverage with ineffective tests may provide a false sense of security.

### 4. What is Big O notation, and how is it used to describe the performance of an algorithm? Give an example of an everyday task (not software-related) that demonstrates O(n) time complexity.

**Big O notation** is used to describe the upper bound or worst-case time complexity of an algorithm as a function of its input size. It helps analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms. 

Example of O(n) time complexity in a non-software context:

- **Everyday Task:** Finding a specific book on an unsorted bookshelf. The time it takes to find the book increases linearly with the number of books (O(n)). If you double the number of books, it roughly doubles the time needed to locate the desired book.
