# Next.js

## 3.4.24

## Statement

This assignment is about exploring and understanding key concepts related to dynamic routes and deployment processes in Next.js, with a focus on how these elements can significantly impact and enhance web application development.

## Questions

### 1. Explain the concept of dynamic routes in Next.js and how they differ from static routes.

In Next.js, dynamic routes allow you to create pages with URLs that depend on external data. Unlike static routes, where the pages are pre-rendered at build time, dynamic routes generate pages on-demand based on the incoming request. This is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of similar pages that share a common layout but have different content.

In Next.js, dynamic routes are defined by creating files inside the `pages` directory with square brackets, such as `[id].js`. The content inside these brackets represents the dynamic parameter. For example, if you have a file named `[id].js`, you can access the value of `id` in your component using the `useRouter` hook.

```jsx
// pages/[id].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function DynamicPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dynamic Page</h1>
      <p>ID: {id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default DynamicPage;
```

### 2. Describe the process of deploying a Next.js application. What are the key steps involved, and what are some deployment platforms you can use?

Deploying a Next.js application typically involves the following key steps:

1. **Build the Application:**
   - Run the `next build` command to generate a production-ready build of your application.

2. **Choose a Deployment Platform:**
   - Common deployment platforms include Vercel, Netlify, and AWS.
   - For Vercel and Netlify, you can connect your repository and configure deployment settings.

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Set environment variables for any sensitive information or configuration needed in your application.

4. **Deploy:**
   - Trigger the deployment process either manually or automatically, depending on your chosen platform.

5. **Monitor and Scale:**
   - Monitor your deployed application for any issues and configure scaling options if necessary.

### 3. How does Next.js handle static file serving? Discuss the default folder structure for storing static assets and explain how to reference them in a Next.js application.

Next.js allows you to serve static files alongside your dynamic pages. The `public` directory is the default location for static assets. For example, if you have an image named `my-image.png` inside the `public` directory, you can reference it in your component like this:

```jsx
// Inside a component
<img src="/my-image.png" alt="My Image" />
```

This URL is resolved at build time, and the asset is optimized and served from the root of your application.

The default folder structure for static assets:

```
project-root
|-- pages
|-- public
|   |-- my-image.png
|-- styles
```

In the above example, the `my-image.png` file in the `public` directory is accessible in your application at the `/my-image.png` URL.
