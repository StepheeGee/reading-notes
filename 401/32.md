# Permissions & Postgresql

## Class 32 - 2.19.24

## Statement

**This assignment discusses the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, their role in securing an API, the purpose of the SQL SELECT statement, and how to use it to retrieve all columns from a table named 'employees.' Additionally, it explores the concept of DRF Generic Views, providing examples of their usage in building a RESTful API.**

## Questions

### 1. What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?


DRF permissions are a crucial part of securing APIs built with Django Rest Framework. They provide a way to control access to resources based on certain conditions. The key components of DRF permissions include:

1. **BasePermission:** It is the base class for all permissions in DRF. Custom permissions can be created by subclassing BasePermission and implementing the `has_permission` and/or `has_object_permission` methods.

2. **IsAuthenticated:** Ensures that the user making the request is authenticated.

3. **IsAdminUser:** Allows access only to admin users.

4. **AllowAny:** Permits unrestricted access to the resource, making it public.

5. **IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly:** Grants read-only access to unauthenticated users while requiring authentication for write operations.

6. **DjangoModelPermissions:** Ties permissions to Django model-level permissions, allowing for fine-grained control based on object-level permissions.

By using these permissions, you can define who can access your API, who can modify data, and under what conditions. This helps in enforcing security policies and protecting sensitive information.


### 2. In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

Purpose:
The SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify which columns to retrieve, which rows to include based on specified conditions, and the order in which the result set should be presented.

Retrieve All Columns from 'employees' Table:
To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees,' you would use the following SQL query:
```
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that represents all columns. This query selects all columns from the 'employees' table, returning every row and every column present in that table.

### 3. Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?

DRF Generic Views are pre-built views provided by Django Rest Framework that simplify the process of creating APIs by providing a set of common views for standard operations. They help in building RESTful APIs by reducing the amount of code that needs to be written. The key generic views include:

1. **ListCreateAPIView:** Combines list and create functionalities, allowing you to list all instances of a model or create a new instance.

2. **RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView:** Combines retrieve, update, and destroy functionalities, allowing you to retrieve a single instance, update it, or delete it.

3. **CreateAPIView:** Handles the creation of new instances.

4. **RetrieveAPIView:** Handles the retrieval of a single instance.

5. **UpdateAPIView:** Handles updating a single instance.

6. **DestroyAPIView:** Handles the deletion of a single instance.

Example of using DRF Generic Views in a views.py file:

```python
from rest_framework.generics import ListCreateAPIView, RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView
from .models import YourModel
from .serializers import YourModelSerializer

class YourModelListCreateView(ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = YourModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = YourModelSerializer

class YourModelRetrieveUpdateDestroyView(RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    queryset = YourModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = YourModelSerializer
```

This example demonstrates the use of `ListCreateAPIView` for listing and creating instances and `RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView` for retrieving, updating, and destroying instances of a model in a RESTful API.
