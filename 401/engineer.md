# Engineering Reading

## Prework - 1.12.24 (late)

## Statement

This assignment required me to perform self reflection to prepare for challenges.

## Questions

### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

Throughout my professional journey, I've demonstrated a relentless commitment to learning and adapting to new challenges - let's call it resilience. This mindset empowers me to approach problems with curiosity, embrace feedback as an opportunity for improvement, and consistently seek out ways to enhance my skills.

### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. **Take a Break and Refresh:**
   - **Walk Away:** Step away from your computer and take a short break. Physical movement and a change of environment can help refresh your mind.
   - **Engage in a Different Task:** Switch to a different, less challenging task for a while. This can provide a mental break and allow your brain to process the challenging problem in the background.
   - **Clear Your Mind:** Engage in activities that help clear your mind, such as a quick walk, stretching, or practicing mindfulness techniques.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - **Divide and Conquer:** Break the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. Focus on solving each subproblem individually before tackling the entire issue.
   - **Write Down Steps:** Document the steps you think are necessary to solve the problem. This can help you visualize the process and identify potential areas of difficulty.
   - **Discuss with Peers:** Seek input from colleagues or online communities. Sometimes, explaining the problem to someone else can lead to new insights or solutions.

3. **Utilize Debugging Tools and Techniques:**
   - **Debugging Statements:** Insert print statements or use debugging tools to trace the execution of your code. This helps identify where the code diverges from your expectations.
   - **Step Through Code:** Use a debugger to step through your code line by line. This allows you to observe the state of variables and identify any unexpected behavior.
   - **Check Documentation:** Review documentation for the programming language or libraries you are using. Sometimes, the solution or a relevant example might be found in the documentation.
