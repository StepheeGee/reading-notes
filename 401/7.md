## Questions

1. **Question: What is variable scope in Python, and how does it differ between local and global scope?**
   
   -  In Python, variable scope refers to the region of the code where a variable can be accessed or modified. There are two main types of scope: local and global. Local scope means the variable is defined within a specific block or function and is only accessible within that block or function. Global scope means the variable is defined outside any function or block and can be accessed throughout the entire code.

   - **Example:**
     ```python
     global_variable = 10  # Global variable

     def my_function():
         local_variable = 5  # Local variable
         print(global_variable)  # Accessing global variable is allowed

     my_function()
     print(global_variable)
     # print(local_variable)  # This would result in an error as local_variable is not accessible outside the function
     ```

2. **Question: How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and when would you use them?**

   -  The `global` keyword is used to declare a variable as global, making it accessible throughout the entire code. The `nonlocal` keyword is used within a nested function to indicate that a variable is not local to that function but belongs to an enclosing (non-global) scope.

3. **Question: What is the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis?**

   -  Big O notation is a way to describe the upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's time complexity or space complexity as a function of the input size. It provides a simplified representation of how the algorithm's performance scales with larger inputs. The notation is crucial for comparing and analyzing the efficiency of algorithms, helping developers choose the most suitable algorithm for a given problem based on its scalability.

4. **Question: How would you simulate a dice roll in Python and calculate the probability of rolling a specific number over multiple trials?**

   - To simulate a dice roll in Python, you can use the `random` module. To calculate the probability, you would run the simulation for a large number of trials and count the occurrences of the specific outcome. Probability is then calculated as the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of trials.

     ```python
     import random

     def simulate_dice_roll(trials, target_number):
         successful_outcomes = 0

         for _ in range(trials):
             dice_result = random.randint(1, 6)  # Simulating a dice roll
             if dice_result == target_number:
                 successful_outcomes += 1

         probability = successful_outcomes / trials
         return probability

     # Example: Simulating and calculating the probability of rolling a 6 in 1000 trials
     probability_of_six = simulate_dice_roll(1000, 6)
     print(f"Probability of rolling a 6: {probability_of_six}")
     ```
