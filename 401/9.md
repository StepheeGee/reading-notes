## Playlist Dynamics: Stacks and Queues Edition

Y'all...try this out, because it's true - 

Spotify Playlist Stack (LIFO):

Curate a playlist on Spotify. Each time you discover a new favorite song, it gets added to the top of the playlist. When you hit play, the music starts with the most recently added track. This demonstrates the Last In, First Out (LIFO) nature of stacks, where the latest addition plays first.
YouTube Music Queue (FIFO):

On the other hand, think about using YouTube Music with its queue feature. As you explore and queue up songs, they line up in a playlist in the order you added them. The first song you added plays first, followed by subsequent additions. This aligns with the First In, First Out (FIFO) concept, where the order of songs in the queue dictates the playback sequence.
