# Pythonisms

## Class 42 - 3.4.24

## Statement

This reading assignment covers advanced Python topics, such as dunder methods, iterators, generators, and decorators. It provides insights into customizing class behavior, creating iterators, understanding generator functions, and using decorators to modify function behavior. 

## Questions

**1. Dunder Methods:**

**Question:**
What are dunder methods in Python, and how do they allow for the customization of built-in behavior in classes? Provide an example of a common dunder method and its purpose.

**Answer:**
Dunder methods, or magic methods, in Python are special methods surrounded by double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`). They enable the customization of built-in behavior in classes by defining methods that Python calls under specific circumstances. For example:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"MyClass instance with value: {self.value}"

# Usage:
obj = MyClass(42)
print(obj)  # Calls obj.__str__()
```

In this example, the `__str__` dunder method customizes the string representation of the class instance, which is implicitly called when using `print`.

**2. Iterators:**

**Question:**
Explain the concept of an iterator in Python. How do you create a custom iterator using the `iter()` and `next()` methods, and why are they important for enabling iteration in a class?

**Answer:**
An iterator in Python is an object representing a stream of data, allowing iteration. To create a custom iterator, implement the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods:

```python
class MyIterator:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.index = 0
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.index < len(self.data):
            result = self.data[self.index]
            self.index += 1
            return result
        else:
            raise StopIteration

# Usage:
my_iter = MyIterator([1, 2, 3, 4])
for item in my_iter:
    print(item)
```

`__iter__` returns the iterator object, and `__next__` defines logic to retrieve the next item. They enable iteration in classes and support the `for` loop.

**3. Generators:**

**Question:**
What is a generator in Python, and how does it differ from a regular function? Illustrate your answer with an example of a generator function using the ‘yield’ keyword.

**Answer:**
A generator in Python is an iterable created using a function with the `yield` keyword. Unlike regular functions, generators can pause execution and yield values one at a time, making them more memory-efficient. Example:

```python
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

# Usage:
for i in countdown(5):
    print(i)
```

The `countdown` function is a generator that yields values from `n` down to 1, pausing execution after each `yield`.

---

**4. Decorators:**

**Question:**
Define decorators in Python and explain their primary use case. How can you create and apply a custom decorator to a function or method? Provide a simple example to demonstrate this concept.

**Answer:**
Decorators in Python are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods. They use the `@decorator` syntax and typically return a new function. A simple example:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Usage:
say_hello()
```

Here, `my_decorator` is a custom decorator adding behavior before and after the `say_hello` function is called. The `@my_decorator` syntax applies the decorator to the function.
