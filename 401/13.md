# Linear Regression

## Class 13 - 1.23.24

## Statement

In today's class, we will delve into the concept of linear regression and its significance in the realm of machine learning and data analysis.

## Questions

### 1. Basic Concept of Linear Regression:

Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The basic idea is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

**Purpose in Machine Learning and Data Analysis:**
- **Prediction:** Linear regression is commonly used for making predictions based on historical data. For example, predicting house prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms.
- **Understanding Relationships:** It helps understand the relationship between independent and dependent variables, providing insights into how changes in one variable affect another.
- **Model Interpretability:** Linear regression models are interpretable, making them useful for explaining and communicating relationships in data.

### 2. Implementation of Linear Regression using Scikit Learn:

Implementing a linear regression model using Python's Scikit Learn library involves the following steps:

- **Import Libraries:**
  ```python
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
  from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
  ```

- **Load and Prepare Data:**
  ```python
  # Assuming 'X' is your feature matrix, and 'y' is your target variable
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
  ```

- **Create and Train the Model:**
  ```python
  model = LinearRegression()
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  ```

- **Make Predictions:**
  ```python
  predictions = model.predict(X_test)
  ```

- **Evaluate Model Performance:**
  ```python
  mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
  print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
  ```

### 3. Purpose of Splitting the Dataset:

The purpose of splitting the dataset into training and test sets is to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. This process is known as train-test splitting.

- **Training Set:**
  - Used to train the model on historical data.
  - The model learns the patterns and relationships present in the training set.

- **Test Set:**
  - Used to evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen data.
  - Helps assess how well the model generalizes and avoids overfitting to the training data.

- **Evaluation:**
  - By comparing predictions on the test set to actual values, you can measure the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error.
  - This process simulates how the model would perform on real-world, unseen data.
