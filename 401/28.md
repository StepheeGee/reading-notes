# Django CRUD and Forms

## 2.13.24 (Class 28)

## Learning objectives:

This assignment will help you understand the basics of Django Forms, Views, and Templates.

## Questions

**1. How do Django Forms facilitate user input handling, and what are some key components of creating a form using the Django framework?**

   *Django Forms:*
   Django Forms are a powerful tool for handling user input in web applications. They provide a way to define and manage forms in a Python class, making it easier to validate and process user data. Key components of creating a form using Django include:

   - **Importing modules:** You start by importing the necessary modules, including `django.forms`.

   - **Defining a form class:** Create a class that inherits from `forms.Form`. This class will define the fields of the form, specifying the type of each field (e.g., CharField, EmailField) and any additional parameters (e.g., required, max_length).

   - **Rendering the form in a view:** Pass an instance of the form to a Django view, and render it in the HTML template. This can be done using the `{{ form }}` template tag.

   - **Handling form submission:** In the view, check if the form is valid (using `form.is_valid()`). If valid, process the data using `form.cleaned_data`.

   - **CSRF protection:** Include the `{\% csrf_token \%}` template tag in the form to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

**2. Explain the purpose of Django Templates in web development and describe how template inheritance can be utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability.**

   *Django Templates:*
   Django Templates are used to generate HTML dynamically in web development. They allow you to embed Python-like code within HTML, facilitating the presentation of data from views. Template inheritance improves code reusability and maintainability by enabling the creation of a base template with common elements, which can be extended by other templates. Key concepts include:

   - **Template tags:** These are enclosed in `{\% \%}` and allow control structures (e.g., if statements, loops) and variable rendering (e.g., `{{ variable }}`).

   - **Template filters:** Filters modify variables in the template, such as formatting dates or converting text to uppercase.

   - **Template inheritance:** The `{\% extends "base_template.html" \%}` tag allows a template to inherit from another. The `{\% block \%}` and `{\% endblock \%}` tags define sections that can be overridden in child templates.

   - **Include tag:** The `{\% include "partial_template.html" \%}` tag allows the inclusion of other templates, promoting modularity.

**3. Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.**

   *Django Views:*
   Django Views handle HTTP requests and are responsible for processing data and returning an appropriate HTTP response. There are two types of views: function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs).

   - **Function-Based Views (FBVs):**
     - Defined as Python functions.
     - Receive an HTTP request as an argument and return an HTTP response.
     - Commonly used for simpler views and when a concise approach is preferred.

   - **Class-Based Views (CBVs):**
     - Defined as Python classes.
     - Allow for organizing code in a more structured manner, using methods for different HTTP methods (e.g., `get()`, `post()`).
     - Provide built-in generic views for common patterns, promoting code reuse.

   - **View Functions:**
     - Handle request processing logic.
     - Interact with models for data retrieval and manipulation.
     - Return HTTP responses, often using Django's `render` function to render HTML templates.

   - **View Classes:**
     - Encapsulate related logic within class methods.
     - Can inherit from generic view classes to leverage pre-built functionality.
     - Promote code organization and readability, especially in complex applications.
