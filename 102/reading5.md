## Designing Web Pages with CSS...baby

### What is the purpose of CSS?

#### In simple terms...

##### *CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is like the makeup for a website. At least that's an analogy that a TA gave me when I asked. It lets designers choose how a website looks (presentation and style)- things like colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts. It keeps the design separate from the words and structure, which makes it easier to change how things look without changing the content itself.*

Here's why this is important:

Making Things Look Good: CSS helps make websites visually appealing by deciding how everything should appear on the screen.

Same Look Everywhere: It helps keep the look of a website consistent across all its pages.

Fitting on Any Screen: With CSS, websites can adjust and look good on various devices like computers, tablets, and phones.

Printing Properly: It ensures that when you print a webpage, it looks neat and organized.

Helping Everyone Access Content: CSS helps make websites accessible to people with disabilities, so everyone can use and understand them.

Loading Faster: It helps websites load quickly, especially if the CSS styles are stored and reused.

Adding Cool Effects: It can make elements on a webpage move or change, making the site more interactive and interesting.

### What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

According to [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), there are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

>>* External CSS
>>* Internal CSS
>>* Inline CSS

###  Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all < p > elements red text.

To style all < p > (paragraph) elements to have red text using CSS, you can create a CSS rule like this:

p {

  color: red;
}

This CSS rule selects all < p > elements and applies the color property, changing it to red. And as a result, all paragraphs on the webpage will have red text. You can place this CSS rule in your external CSS file or within a < styl e> block in the < head > section of your HTML file.
