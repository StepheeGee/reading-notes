### What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

**Real-world use case for the alt attribute:** The `alt` attribute in HTML is essential for improving web accessibility, especially for users with disabilities. A common use case is on e-commerce websites. When a product image is displayed, the `alt` attribute can provide a concise description of the product. For example, for a product image of a red bicycle, the `alt` attribute might contain "Red Bicycle - Model XYZ." This description assists screen readers in conveying the information to visually impaired users who rely on audio cues to navigate the web.

### How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

**Improving accessibility of images:** To enhance the accessibility of images, web developers should use the `alt` attribute for all images, as mentioned in the previous answer. Additionally, consider providing text descriptions when images contain important information. For complex images or charts, offer detailed textual explanations nearby. It's also important to ensure sufficient color contrast for users with vision impairments, and avoid conveying critical information through color alone.

### Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

**Example of when the figure element is useful:** The `<figure>` element is used to group together an image and its caption. For instance, if you have an article about famous landmarks, you can use `<figure>` to wrap an image of the Eiffel Tower and a `<figcaption>` element to provide a caption like "The Eiffel Tower in Paris, France." This aids in structuring content and makes it semantically meaningful.

### Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

**Difference between a gif and an svg image (explained to an elder):** A GIF image is like a digital flipbook; it's a series of pictures shown one after the other to create a moving image, like a cartoon. GIFs are simple but can be large in size. On the other hand, an SVG image is like a digital drawing; it uses lines and shapes to create pictures. SVGs are typically smaller and look sharp at any size, like a detailed painting. They're great for icons and logos on websites.

### What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

**Image type for displaying a screenshot:** For displaying a screenshot on a website, I'd use a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image. PNG images are lossless, meaning they don't lose quality when saved. Screenshots often have text and details that need to be clear, and PNG images are excellent for preserving this clarity.

### Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

**Foreground and background colors:** Foreground color is like the color of the writing or text on a piece of paper. When you write a letter or type something on your computer, the color of the words you see on the page is the foreground color. It's what you read, and it's the main color that stands out.

Background color is like the color of the paper itself. Imagine you have a piece of paper, and it can be white, yellow, blue, or any other color. The color of the paper that makes your text stand out is the background color. I

### Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

**Adding color to a colorless blog:** To make my friend's blog more interesting, I would start by selecting colors for the text and backgrounds. Use bright colors for headings to catch the reader's attention and calmer colors for the main text. I could also use color for links, making them stand out. I would also add some box shadows to the outline of elements on the blog. And I would definitely check the lighthouse score to make sure my color choices were optimally accessible.

### What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

**Choosing fonts:** When picking fonts for a website, it's like selecting a style for your book's text. Consider the readability; some fonts are easier to read on screens. Also, think about the mood â€“ a fancy font might be great for a wedding invitation but not for a serious article.

### What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

**Font properties:** These properties help you change how the text looks. 

* `Font-size` controls how big or small the text is, like adjusting the size of the letters in your book.

* `Font-weight` determines how bold or light the text is, similar to how strong or faint the letters appear.

* `Font-style` allows you to make text italic, giving it a slanted appearance.

### Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

**Adding spacing to an h1 element:** 

1. One way is by using `margin` to create space around the entire h1 element. 

2. The other way is by using `padding` to add space inside the h1 element, pushing the characters away from the edges.
