    <p>What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?</p></div>

1. **Empathy:** When team members are extended compassion in a safe environment, they are more likely to speak up, share their ideas and opinions, and take risks without fear of ridicule or retribution.

2. **Open and Inclusive Communication:** Teams that foster psychological safety encourage open and inclusive communication. This means that all team members are given equal opportunities to express their thoughts, ideas, and concerns. There should be a culture of active listening and a willingness to consider different perspectives.

3. **Freedom to Experiment and Learn:** Teams that operate with psychological safety allow members to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them without fear of blame or negative consequences. This encourages innovation and continuous improvement, as team members are more likely to take calculated risks and explore new approaches.

    <p>Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.</p></div>


- I consider Code Fellows a professional setting, considering the standards, code of conduct, and customs. One thing that I have appreciated in this setting is the amount of compassion and empathy extended. Mistakes are okay. This culture recognizes that as humans we will make mistakes. So instead of scrutinizing the mistakes, I've watched, in action, mistakes being utilized as an opportunity to clarify the expectations and measure growth.

High levels of psychological safety within teams can have several positive impacts:

1. **Increased Creativity and Innovation:** Team members feel free to express their ideas and take risks, leading to greater creativity and innovation within the team.

2. **Enhanced Problem-Solving:** Open and inclusive communication fosters better problem-solving as diverse viewpoints are considered, leading to more effective solutions.

3. **Better Team Morale:** Team members in psychologically safe teams tend to have higher morale and job satisfaction because they feel valued and respected.

4. **Higher Productivity:** Psychological safety can lead to increased engagement, motivation, and productivity as team members are more willing to contribute their best efforts.

5. **Lower Turnover:** Teams with psychological safety tend to experience lower turnover rates because team members are happier and more likely to stay in a supportive and respectful environment.
