#### A Growth Mindset is...
###### **The courage to keep trying, trusting that improvement will follow.** 

#### These are the reminders that I will use to keep myself in a Growth Mindset:

###### 1. 	~~I can't do this shit.~~ Failure is a part of the learning process. You're out of your comfort zone, Steph. And that's where you should be.
###### 2. Take a break. It's ok. 
###### 3. Ask for help. Be brave.
