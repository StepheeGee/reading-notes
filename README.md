#### This is My Personal Definition of Growth Mindset:
###### **The courage to keep trying, trusting that improvement will follow.** :two_hearts:

#### These are the reminders I will use to keep myself in a growth mindset.

###### 1. 	~~I can't do this shit.~~ Failure is a part of the learning process. You're out of your comfort zone, Stephee. And that's where you should be.
###### 2. Take a break. It's ok. 
###### 3. Ask for help. Be brave.
