Hey, I'm Steph. Join me on my journey of learning and mastering Software Development. I'm all in, committed to expanding my knowledge in this ever-evolving domain. Over the years, I've grasped the impact of a growth mindset in driving progress toward personal and academic goals. 

So...Let's dive in! You down?

In the words of Carol Dweck, a pioneer in mindset psychology: 
> "In a growth mindset, challenges are exciting rather than threatening. So rather than thinking, 'Oh, I'm going to reveal my weaknesses,' you say, 'Wow, here's a chance to grow.'"

With a growth mindset, I'm excited to face challenges, embrace failures as opportunities to learn, and continuously strive for improvement.

#### Reminders & Encouragement:

1. 	~~I can't do this shit.~~ Failure is a part of the learning process. You're out of your comfort zone, Steph. And that's where you should be.
2. Take a break. It's ok. 
3. Ask for help. Be brave.
